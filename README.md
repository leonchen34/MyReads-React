# MyReads-React

This is a project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 
In this Project, the main page shows three shelves for books, 
"Currently Reading", "Wanted To Read", and "Read". You can move books
among those shelves. Click on a book will show detail information about 
the book. At the right bottom corner, "+" button will  allow you to search 
books and add to a book shelf.
